What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? - I think, as me and Jason discussed, the more difficult parts of git were push, pull, merge, fork, and fetch, and what all of them mean. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS? - I definitely feel like push/pull were clarified, and I'm going to work on understanding merge, fork and fetch this week. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? - I had some issue figuring out how to add an image inline to a markdown file, so I had to ask both Jason and Joey for assistance. 

What still confuses you about Git? - I think just differentiating between consistantly updated remote and local repositories is still difficult for me. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? - Good! I think both Jason and I had a good time and learned a lot.
